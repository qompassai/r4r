## Abstract
### Background
The rapid integration of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) into medical education has ushered in transformative changes, offering innovative tools and methodologies that enhance learning and practice. AI applications, such as adaptive learning platforms and virtual patient simulations, have become increasingly prevalent, providing personalized and immersive educational experiences. These advancements not only improve educational outcomes but also address critical needs across diverse learner populations. 

However, the swift adoption of AI technologies has highlighted significant ethical considerations, particularly concerning bias, transparency, and equitable access. In this context, our pilot study focused on harnessing genAI to enhance mentorship for aspiring orthopedic surgeons, especially those from marginalized backgrounds or institutions lacking dedicated orthopedic residencies. By developing a prototype model that delivers high-quality, personalized mentorship content, we strive to democratize access to essential resources, ensuring that all candidates have the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their circumstances.


### Methods
In response to noticeably increasing cost of AI medical education, our study focuses on the deployment of quantized, small-scale AI models on-device. This approach aims to ensure accessibility and equity, particularly for underfunded institutions and learners from non-traditional, disabled, and underrepresented minority populations. We began by selecting open-source AI models renowned for their efficacy in educational contexts. To optimize these models for deployment on resource-constrained hardware, we employed quantization techniques, which reduce the precision of the model's parameters, thereby decreasing memory usage and computational demands without significantly compromising performance. Our deployment environment comprised consumer-grade Linux computers, reflecting hardware commonly available in underserved regions. We utilized standard Linux distributions, ensuring all software dependencies were met. To enhance computational efficiency, we leveraged NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA 12.8) for on-device acceleration, enabling the models to utilize available GPU resources. The quantized models were integrated into the system in transient sandboxed environments as well as via hard-coded web-based application program interfaces (APIs)  to streamline deployment and ensure consistency across various infrastructures.

### Q: How do you mitigate against bias?

**TLDR - we do math to make AI ethically useful**

### A: We delineate between mathematical bias (MB) - a fundamental parameter in neural network equations - and algorithmic/social bias (ASB). While MB is optimized during model training through backpropagation, ASB requires careful consideration of data sources, model architecture, and deployment strategies. We implement attention mechanisms for improved input processing and use legal open-source data and secure web-search APIs to help mitigate ASB.

 ### AI Math at a glance

## Forward Propagation Algorithm

$$
y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b
$$

Where:

- $y$ represents the model output
- $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ are input features
- $(w_1, w_2, ..., w_n)$ are feature weights
- $b$ is the bias term
### Neural Network Activation

For neural networks, the bias term is incorporated before activation:

$$
z = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_ix_i + b
$$
$$
a = \sigma(z)
$$

Where:
- $z$ is the weighted sum plus bias
- $a$ is the activation output
- $\sigma$ is the activation function

### Attention Mechanism- aka what makes the Transformer (The "T" in ChatGPT) powerful

[Attention High level overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjJOgb-E41w)
[Attention Is All You Need Arxiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)

The attention mechanism equation is:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V
$$

Where:
- $Q$ represents the Query matrix
- $K$ represents the Key matrix
- $V$ represents the Value matrix
- $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors
- $\text{softmax}(\cdot)$ normalizes scores to sum to 1

### How is it $0 cost?

* We self-host models and we thoughtfully implement open source software and write our own code. All hardware was already purchased prior to the grant being awarded.
* We public-source the code-bases under dual-license at no cost to learners or educators not intending on enterprise-grade commercial use. We make $0 in public-sourcing our code.
* We make efficient use of our free memberships to the NVIDIA, Meta, Groq, and Github developer programs

### Q: Do I have to buy a Linux computer to use this? I don't have time for that!
### A: No. You can run Linux and/or the tools we share alongside your existing operating system:
    * Windows users can use Windows Subsystem for Linux [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
    * Mac users can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    * The code-base instructions were developed with both beginners and advanced users in mind.

### Q: Do you have to get a masters in AI?
### A: Not if you don't want to. To get competent enough to get past ChatGPT dependence at least, you just need a computer and a beginning's mindset. Huggingface is a good place to start.

## What a Dual-License means

### Protection for Vulnerable Populations

The dual licensing aims to address the cybersecurity gap that disproportionately affects underserved populations. As highlighted by recent attacks[^1], low-income residents, seniors, and foreign language speakers face higher-than-average risks of being victims of cyber attacks. By offering both open-source and commercial licensing options, we encourage the development of cybersecurity solutions that can reach these vulnerable groups while also enabling sustainable development and support.

### Preventing Malicious Use

The AGPL-3.0 license ensures that any modifications to the software remain open source, preventing bad actors from creating closed-source variants that could be used for exploitation. This is especially crucial given the rising threats to vulnerable communities, including children in educational settings. The attack on Minneapolis Public Schools, which resulted in the leak of 300,000 files and a $1 million ransom demand, highlights the importance of transparency and security[^6].

### Addressing Cybersecurity in Critical Sectors

The commercial license option allows for tailored solutions in critical sectors such as healthcare, which has seen significant impacts from cyberattacks. For example, the recent Change Healthcare attack[^2] affected millions of Americans and caused widespread disruption for hospitals and other providers. In January 2025, CISA[^7] and FDA[^8] jointly warned of critical backdoor vulnerabilities in Contec CMS8000 patient monitors, revealing how medical devices could be compromised for unauthorized remote access and patient data manipulation.
### Supporting Cybersecurity Awareness

The dual licensing model supports initiatives like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) efforts to improve cybersecurity awareness[^3] in "target rich" sectors, including K-12 education. By allowing both open-source and commercial use, we aim to facilitate the development of tools that support these critical awareness and protection efforts.

### Bridging the Digital Divide

The unfortunate reality is that a number of individuals and organizations have gone into a frenzy in every facet of our daily lives[^4]. These unfortunate folks identify themselves with their talk of "10X" returns and building towards Artificial General Intelligence aka "AGI" while offering GPT wrappers. Our dual licensing approach aims to acknowledge this deeply concerning predatory paradigm with clear eyes while still doing operating to bring the best parts of the open-source community with our services and solutions.

### Recent Cybersecurity Attacks

Recent attacks underscore the importance of robust cybersecurity measures:

- The Change Healthcare cyberattack in February 2024[^2] affected millions of Americans and caused significant disruption to healthcare providers.
- The White House and Congress jointly designated October 2024 as Cybersecurity Awareness Month[^5]. This designation comes with over 100 actions that align the Federal government and public/private sector partners are taking to help every man, woman, and child to safely navigate the age of AI. 

By offering both open-source and commercial licensing options, we strive to create a balance that promotes innovation and accessibility while also providing the necessary resources and flexibility to address the complex cybersecurity challenges faced by vulnerable populations and critical infrastructure sectors.
